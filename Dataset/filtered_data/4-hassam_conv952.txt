2/14/24, 9:09â€¯PM - Muhammad Omar Farooq: Test.bst: This file contains the visual representation of the binary search tree (BST) after initialization and after each operation specified in the operation_file. It visually represents the structure of the BST with nodes and their connections. The format may vary, but it typically shows the tree structure using spaces and lines to represent the hierarchy. The content of this file is generated by the C++ program based on the operations performed on the BST.
