5/18/24, 8:30 PM - Muhammad Omar Farooq: In the context of AES, \( w[i] \) represents the words in the expanded key schedule. The AES key schedule is the process by which the cipher key is expanded into multiple round keys used in each round of encryption. For AES-128, the key schedule produces 44 words (each word is 32 bits, or 4 bytes), which are used to generate the round keys for 10 rounds of encryption.
