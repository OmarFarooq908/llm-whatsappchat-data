2/5/23, 2:44 PM - Hamza Sardar Sr UET 20CP: DNS:(Domain Name Space)

Domain Name Space aik Naming system hai for Web. Means ham ne agar kisi b Web page ko acces karna hai to ham naming system k through karte hain 

Is mn main kaam hai Domain Name to IP address conversion is k liye hmare pass aik Domain Name Server hota hai that takes Domain Name as Input and returns an IP address. That IP address is broadcasted aur phir wo destination pe jata

Domain Hierarchy:

domain Hierarchy mn Domain levels ko discuss karte hain 

Agar aik address hai 

www.uetaxila.edu.pk 

.pk aik top level Domain hai baaqi sab is ki sub domains hain 
 
.edu sub Domain hai aur aese hi is se peeche is ko sub domains hain

DDNS: (Dynamic DNS)

is mn aik problem ka solution hai k with time hmare pass IP address ki demand barh rahi hai to so static address out dated hain 

So ham har domain k liye Dynamic IP address assign karte

What if I told you there's a smarter way to learn—one where every lesson feels tailor-made just for you? Get ready to say goodbye to one-size-fits-all education and hello to a whole new world of personalized learning with AI! I am Muhammad Omar Farooq (20-CP-33) along with my group members Muhammad Zia Ullah, Mudassir Ali Haider, Muhammad Jahangir, and Zabiullah.

In today's fast-paced educational landscape, we're facing some major challenges. First off, traditional education tends to be one-size-fits-all, leaving many of us feeling disengaged and uninspired. Secondly, we struggle with retention—we cram for exams only to forget everything shortly after. And thirdly, there's a significant inefficiency in how resources are allocated—both in terms of time and money.

But fear not, because we're here to shake things up! Our solution? Personalized Course Content Generation Using AI. Picture this: a learning experience that's tailored specifically to your needs, preferences, and learning style. No more slogging through irrelevant material or feeling left behind in class. With our platform, every lesson is customized just for you.

So how does it work? Our AI algorithms analyze your learning patterns, strengths, and weaknesses to curate a personalized curriculum just for you. Whether you're a visual learner, an auditory learner, or somewhere in between, we've got you covered. And the best part? Our platform adapts in real-time, so you're always getting the content that's most relevant to you.

Now, let's talk business. We're rolling out with a subscription model, making it accessible to all students from the get-go. And down the line, we're exploring additional revenue streams like licensing fees and premium content offerings.

Of course, bringing this vision to life comes with its costs. We're looking at rental hardware, development, and marketing expenses, totaling 830,000 PKR for our first year of operation. But with your support, we're confident that we can make personalized learning a reality for students everywhere.

Join us on this journey to revolutionize education. Together, let's say goodbye to the old way of learning and hello to a future where every student's potential is unlocked. Thank you."

5/22/24, 8:19 AM - Muhammad Omar Farooq: Certainly! Here are the solutions to the questions:

Question #1:
a. To make Apache pay attention to just one IP address on the server, you can configure it to listen on a specific IP address by modifying the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) and specifying the IP address in the "Listen" directive.

b. Name-based virtual hosting allows hosting multiple websites on a single IP address by using the "Host" header in HTTP requests to determine which website to serve. IP-based virtual hosting, on the other hand, assigns each website a unique IP address. Name-based virtual hosting is useful when hosting multiple websites with different domain names on a single server.

c. To prevent unauthorized laptops from using a network that uses DHCP for dynamic addressing, you can implement MAC address filtering on the DHCP server, where only specific MAC addresses are allowed to obtain an IP address.

d. Yes, DHCP can support statically defined addresses by configuring reservations in the DHCP server based on the MAC address of the device.

e. I've already answered this question in (a).

f. To see all the files and directories installed and created by a package (e.g., httpd), you can use the command "rpm -ql httpd".

g. I've already answered this question in (b).

h. If password-based authentication is disabled, you can use SSH key-based authentication to login to the servers securely.

i. I've already answered this question in (c).

j. The RPM command in Linux is used to manage software packages. It can be used to install, uninstall, update, query, and verify packages.

Question #2:
DHCP server dynamically assigns IP addresses to hosts in Linux by leasing IP addresses to clients for a specific period. When a client requests an IP address, the DHCP server checks its pool of available addresses and assigns one to the client, along with other network configuration information such as subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server.

Question #3:
The Samba server consists of several services and daemons. Daemons related to Samba, such as smbd and nmbd, can be started, stopped, and managed using the init scripts or systemctl command on Linux. Additionally, the smb service is responsible for controlling the overall Samba server functionality, including starting and stopping the daemons and managing shares and access control.

Good luck with your lab quiz! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
