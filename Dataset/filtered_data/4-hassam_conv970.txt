They will be in word, powerpoint and pdf formats. These tools would extract key terms, clauses, and important information related to the financial considerations, and accounting principles. Please let me know what would need from me to arrive at an estimate time and costs?
2/20/24, 10:33 PM - Hassam Malik UET BCE: For example I want to create an AI interface that asks questions to help create a PowerPoint deck from a pre-branded template. For example imagine a PowerPoint template is predesigned like attached. The AI would ask questions to update / edit the content each time to create a new custimised powerpoint each time using the base. It would keep information retained like the people profiles, and the user jsut says who to include. Make sense?
